# SMT_exp

**SMT** (Scattering Matrix Tomography) uses scattering matrices to achieve high-resolution deep imaging inside scattering media with confocal spatio-temporal gates, digital pulse compression, refractive-index mismath correction, and additional wavefront corrections for bot input and output.

This repository includes codes used in the epxerimental implementation of SMT.
Using [<code>run_all.m</code>](./reconstruct_SMT/run_all.m), one can generate SMT images from the experimentally measured hyperspectral reflection matrix.
Detailed documentation is given in the comments of the function files.
