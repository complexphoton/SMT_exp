# SMT_exp

**SMT** (Scattering Matrix Tomography) uses scattering matrices to achieve high-resolution deep imaging inside scattering media with digital pulse compression, refractive-index mismath correction, and additional wavefront corrections for bot input and output.

Using [<code>ru_all.m</code>], one can generate SMT images from the experimentally measured hyperspectral reflection matrix.

Detailed documentation is given in comments the function files.
